Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan â€” Gen AI Developer & Startups Founder. I help founders, marketers, and operators launch real GPT-powered systems that work: smart, scalable, and fast. I build custom AI agents using LangChain, Python, and the best of todayâ€™s LLM stack.

## âœ… What Can I Build for You
I design and implement production-ready AI agents and GPT-powered systems, end-to-end â€” from architecture to automation.

### Custom AI Agents with LangChain
- Multi-agent setups, tool use, memory, RAG, workflows
- Python-built with full control, or n8n for no-code orchestration
- Clean logic, retry flows, fallback, and production readiness

### LLM-Powered Bots for Business
- Sales agents (lead scoring, outreach generation)
- Support bots (GPT + knowledgebase, RAG-enhanced)
- Internal assistants (HR, SOP, onboarding, search)

### AI Integrations into Existing Systems
- CRM bots (Zoho, Notion, Airtable, Google Sheets)
- External API connections and webhooks
- Slack, email, calendar, Notion, and more

### Special Use Cases
- GPT-based comment and post writers (e.g. for LinkedIn)
- Daily insight bots (market trends, TikTok, Reddit)
- Content repurposing and briefing tools for teams

### Vector Database & RAG Systems
- Supabase, Pinecone, Chroma setup
- File loaders, chunking, embedding, and semantic search
- Integrated with LangChain pipelines and GPT calls

## ðŸ§° Tools I use:
LangChain â€¢ Python â€¢ GPT-4 / GPT-4o â€¢ n8n â€¢ Supabase â€¢ Zapier â€¢ Airtable â€¢ Notion â€¢ Zoho â€¢ Perplexity

Iâ€™m not just an engineer â€” Iâ€™m a founder and entrepreneur.
Iâ€™ve launched startups, shipped SaaS platforms, and built AI systems that save real time, generate revenue, and scale.
I work fast, communicate clearly, and focus on what matters: making your idea real.

ðŸ“© Letâ€™s talk â€” Iâ€™m here to help you build your AI system from zero to working in days, not months.
